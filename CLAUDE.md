## What this is

**rostr** — open-source fantasy sports on Solana, football first. Web app and native app,
targeting the **Solana Seeker dApp Store**.

Owner: [@6figpsolseeker](https://github.com/6figpsolseeker). Previously shipped
[`percolator-mobile`](https://github.com/6figpsolseeker/percolator-mobile) to Seeker
(React Native 0.81 + Expo 54 bare, Mobile Wallet Adapter, Seed Vault) — **use it as the
reference build for anything mobile.**

The thesis in one line: every other fantasy platform asks you to trust an administrator;
this one replaces that trust with immutable rules, escrowed funds, and automatic
settlement.

## Hard deadlines

Today's date matters more than usual here.

| Date            | What                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aug 22 2026** | Leagues must be creatable, joinable, fundable, **draftable**  |
| **Sep 9 2026**  | **NFL kickoff.** Lineups lock, scoring runs, matchups resolve |
| Sep 16          | Waivers (Week 2)                                              |
| Nov 22          | Trade deadline (Week 11)                                      |
| Dec 13          | First real payout — regular-season prize (Week 14)            |
| Jan 3 2027      | Championship (Week 17)                                        |
| Jan 10 2027     | Final payouts, after the 7-day correction window              |

Two of these are hard: **Aug 22** and **Sep 9**. Everything else has months of runway.
Miss the season and the next real-data window is September 2027.

**The NFL calendar is the release schedule.** Settlement code does not run until January.
Do not build it in August.

## Where we are

See [`docs/BUILD-PLAN.md`](docs/BUILD-PLAN.md) for the full commit-by-commit plan.

**Done — 433 tests, CI green:**

- Full specification — rules, data model, live scoring, build plan
- A1: pnpm monorepo, TS strict, vitest, eslint, prettier, CI
- A2: sport registry (`packages/core/src/sports/`)
- A3–A5: canonical encoding, rule schema, hashing, validation
- A6: Postgres migrations (`packages/db/migrations/`), forward-only runner, PGlite tests
- A7: `seedSport()` and `createLeague()` — validate, hash, freeze, all in one transaction
- A8: `@rostr/pinning` — pin the canonical document, verify the round trip, `setRulesUri()`
- A9: identity — users, email verification, wallet linking
- A10–A11: `apps/web` — Next.js 15, Tailwind 4, wallet adapter, full rules rendered
  before the join control
- A12: `buildJoinMessage()` / `joinLeague()` — signature over the rules hash, verified
  server-side

- B1–B5: the scoring engine (`packages/core/src/scoring/`) — integer milli-points, tiered
  ladders tested at every boundary

- B9–B15: snake draft, queue, auto-pick, bots (`packages/core/src/draft/`)

- Waivers and free agency (`packages/core/src/waivers/`) — ESPN's cycle exactly:
  Tuesday 00:00 ET back to waivers, Wednesday 03:00 ET processing, free agency between,
  1-day waiver period, 24-hour short-tenure rule

- C1, and the standings half of C8 plus all of C9: schedule generation, records,
  tiebreaker chain, playoff seeding (`packages/core/src/season/`). **Matchup resolution
  itself still needs C6** — the scoring engine exists but nothing yet feeds team-week
  totals into `MatchupResult`.

- B6–B8: Tank01 adapter, box scores, live sync (`packages/stats/`, `packages/db/sync.ts`)

- B16: the draft persisted (`packages/db/src/draft.ts`, migration `0009`)

**Next, in order:**

1. **Draft UI** — the draft is fully persisted and fully tested but there is no room to
   run it in. This is the Aug 22 deadline and nothing else on the list competes with it.
2. **Finish A9's UI** — there is no session yet, so `JoinPanel` posts an empty `userId`
   and the league creation form is a preview only. Both marked TODO in the code. The
   database is live now, so this is unblocked.
3. **C2, C3, C6** — lineups, per-player kickoff locks, and team-week scoring. Needed by
   Sep 9, not Aug 22. C6 is what finally connects the scoring engine to `MatchupResult`.
4. **D1–D10** — the escrow program. **Write this early.** The audit is 2–4 weeks of
   calendar time and it gates pot leagues opening on Aug 22. Blocked on the secondary PC
   (no Rust/Anchor).

**Still open on the draft:** the order seed is grindable. `createDraftRecord` takes a
seed and records it, but nothing yet supplies a Solana slot hash from at or after
`scheduledAt`. Until it does, the order is fair only for leagues without a pot — see the
comment on `generateDraftOrder`.

### The draft

`packages/core/src/draft/`. Pure state machine — transitions return new state, nothing
runs a clock or touches a database. That is why slow drafts need no real-time
infrastructure and why a full 12-team draft plays out instantly in a test.

- **Order is seeded, never `Math.random`.** Anyone holding the seed can recompute it and
  confirm nobody reshuffled. Use the league's rules hash: already on-chain, already
  unforgeable.
- **Roster legality is bipartite matching** (`roster.ts`), not per-position counting.
  Counting is _wrong_ because of FLEX — see the comment at the top of that file before
  changing it. This underpins the rule that stops six quarterbacks and no kicker.
- **One auto-pick routine serves clock expiry and every bot.** Do not fork them. Two
  implementations would diverge, and the divergence would read as "the bot outdrafted me
  while I was asleep".

Bot sophistication is still the open question: the current bots draft by need from a
supplied ranking. Positional scarcity, bye weeks, and tier breaks are not modelled.

**Persistence lives in `packages/db/src/draft.ts` and adds exactly one thing the engine
cannot do: arbitration.** The engine is pure and single-threaded, so when two managers
click at the same instant both read "pick 15 is open", both validate, and both are right.
The database decides instead — `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the draft row is the fast path,
and `PRIMARY KEY (draft_id, pick_number)` plus `UNIQUE (draft_id, player_id)` are the
backstop if anything ever writes outside that lock. Both are tested.

A pick writes the `draft_picks` row, the `roster_entries` row, and the queue cleanup in
**one transaction**. A pick recorded without a roster entry leaves a team owning a player
nothing else in the system can see.

`PickRow["source"]` is imported from the engine, not restated. Writing that union out by
hand is how the `draft_pick_source` enum and the engine drifted apart the first time —
the migration had `NEEDED_SLOT` and `ANY_LEGAL`, which the engine has never emitted.

Clocks are **computed from `clock_started_at`, never scheduled.** That is what lets a
24-hour slow draft run with no timer infrastructure: `draftsWithExpiredPicks()` returns
the work list and a job auto-picks through it. A pause clears the clock, so a manager
resumes with a full fresh timer rather than losing sixty of their ninety seconds to an
outage they had nothing to do with.

### The season

`packages/core/src/season/`. Both files are pure — no clock, no database.

**The schedule is a seeded round robin**, from the rules hash, by the circle method. Two
things it must keep doing, each of which was a real bug caught by a test:

- **Sort the team IDs before shuffling.** A shuffle permutes positions, not identities,
  so shuffling the caller's array made the schedule depend on the order teams were passed
  in — and therefore on database row order.
- **Assign home and away in a second pass**, to whoever is furthest behind. Deriving it
  from the rotation geometry gave one team eleven home games out of fourteen, because
  only the held team keeps a fixed pair index.

Odd leagues get byes, spread evenly. A bye is not a game: no win, no loss, no points, and
it does not count toward games played, so win percentage stays comparable.

**Standings resolve ties by group, not pairwise.** A comparator that consults each
tiebreaker in turn is _wrong_ for head-to-head: A beating B says nothing about C, so
`a > b > c > a` is reachable and the result depends on what the sort algorithm visited.
Instead, rank by one tiebreaker, then re-apply the next _within_ each still-tied group.
Head-to-head is skipped entirely when the tied teams did not all meet the same number of
times — comparing records across different schedules is not a tiebreaker.

`computeStandings` **throws** if the chain runs out with teams still tied. Falling back to
input order would make a playoff seed depend on database row order, and playoff seeds
decide who can win the pot.

### Scoring

`scorePlayer()` and `scoreTeamWeek()` in `packages/core/src/scoring/engine.ts`. Pure, no
I/O, no sport knowledge — a test scores an invented cricket-shaped rule set to prove it.

Three behaviours that are deliberate and should not be "fixed":

- **Absent is not zero.** A stat key missing from the input contributes nothing. Correct
  for a player who did not appear — but it means a defense that allowed 0 points needs an
  explicit `def_pts_allowed: 0` to earn the shutout bonus. **That is the provider
  adapter's job.**
- **An uncovered tier value throws.** A negative points-allowed means the feed is broken;
  scoring zero would bury it.
- **Bench and IR are scored but not counted.** Managers want to see what they left out.
  The filter comes from the league's own roster rules, not a hardcoded slot list.

Fixtures in `scoring/fixtures.ts` are **constructed, not real box scores**, and labelled
as such. Validating against real 2025 data is the outstanding half of B5 and needs the
Tank01 key.

### The web app

`apps/web`, Next.js 15 App Router. `pnpm --filter @rostr/web dev`. It needs
`DATABASE_URL` to do anything beyond render the home page.

Two things worth not undoing:

**`RulesView` renders above the join control, always, and in full.** Nothing is collapsed
behind a toggle and no field is omitted. A join button placed before the rules would make
"shown before you join" a technicality rather than a fact.

**The join message is fetched from the server, never composed on the client.** A client
that builds its own message could sign one rule set and be admitted under another.

**`/scoring` explains the point system, and is generated from `NFL_PPR_SCORING`.** Not
hand-written — a scoring explainer typed out by hand drifts the first time a value
changes and then quietly lies to users about how they are being scored. The worked
examples call `scorePlayer()` rather than stating totals, so the arithmetic on the page
cannot diverge from the arithmetic that decides matchups. **The mobile app needs the same
screen, built the same way** (commit H3b).

**Wallets:** Phantom, Solflare, and Coinbase adapters are registered explicitly, but most
wallets — including Seed Vault on Seeker — auto-register via the Wallet Standard and need
nothing. Do **not** add `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`: that meta-package pulls in
Ledger USB bindings, the Stellar SDK, and protobufjs, roughly 500 packages, for wallets
nobody here uses.

Migrations are not exported from `@rostr/db`'s main entry — `migrate.ts` reads SQL from
disk, which a bundler cannot statically analyse. Import from `@rostr/db/migrate` in CLI
and setup code only.

### Pinning

`pinLeagueRules()` pins the canonical bytes, **fetches them back, and re-hashes** before
returning. Never skip the read-back: a `rules_uri` resolving to anything other than the
hashed document is worse than no URI, because it looks verified.

`PinataPinningService` uses **`pinFileToIPFS`, never `pinJSONToIPFS`.** Our document is
valid JSON, so the JSON endpoint looks right — but it re-serialises server-side,
reordering keys and reformatting numbers, which changes the bytes and therefore the hash.
There is a test asserting the endpoint, so this cannot regress silently.

### League creation

`createLeague()` in `packages/db/src/leagues.ts` is the only moment a league's rules are
writable. It validates, hashes, and writes in a single transaction — so there is no state
in which a league exists with rules that were never checked, and a partial write leaves
nothing behind.

`league_rules.canonical` holds the exact bytes that were hashed, verbatim. That is what
gets pinned, and what anyone can re-hash to check against the chain. `verifyStoredRules()`
does exactly that.

The denormalised `league_scoring_rules` and `league_roster_slots` are **copies**, never
references to a shared template — a template edit must never be able to reach a league
that already exists. They carry the same immutability triggers.

### Database

Tests run on **PGlite** — real Postgres compiled to WASM, in-process, no service, no
Docker, no credentials. `createTestDatabase()` in `packages/db/src/testing.ts` gives a
fresh migrated database per test.

The real database is **Supabase** (hosted, so it follows you between machines; also
matches the stack in `percolator-launch`). Not set up yet — see
[`docs/SETUP-REQUIRED.md`](docs/SETUP-REQUIRED.md).

Migrations are **forward-only** plain SQL. There are no down migrations: a league's rules
are immutable and its history must stay auditable, so the answer to a bad migration is
another migration. Editing an already-applied file makes the runner refuse to start.

---

## Invariants — do not break these

**1. The rules hash is load-bearing.** `packages/core/src/canonical.ts` defines the only
legal encoding of a rule set. Its SHA-256 goes on-chain and members sign it when they
join. If encoding drifts, every league created before the drift stops verifying.

There is a **golden fixture test** pinning
`5afc934db3b3e1b1f5ec7a9e503f61e531aa925a6f966c41ec227118201da36a`. If it fails, do
**not** update the constant to make it pass — find what changed the encoding. CI checks it
on Node 22 and 24 for exactly this reason.

**2. No floating point, anywhere near money or scoring.** Scoring is integer
**milli-points** (1 point = 1000). Percentages are **basis points** (100% = 10000).
Thresholds are explicit numerator/denominator pairs. Token amounts are decimal **strings**
(on-chain u64). `canonicalize()` throws on any non-integer, by design.

Why: passing yards score 0.04/yd. Accumulate floats across a season and matchups decided
by hundredths — which happens constantly — resolve wrong.

**3. Sports are data, never structure.** `packages/core/src/sports/nfl.ts` is the only
file permitted to name a football concept. If you find yourself writing
`if (sport === 'nfl')` or a column called `passing_yards`, the abstraction has leaked.

**4. Rules are immutable after league creation.** No commissioner override, no admin
edit, no migration that touches an existing league's rules. The only escape hatches are
unanimous consent to amend and unanimous/automatic dissolve with refunds.

**5. Paying weeks wait 7 days.** Official NFL stat corrections arrive for up to a week
after a game. Weeks 14 and 17 pay money and must finalise at T+168h. Other weeks finalise
at T+48h. Validation enforces this.

## Settled — do not re-open

These were discussed at length and decided. Re-proposing them wastes the owner's time.

## Environment

**This repo was started on a secondary Windows PC.** Tooling installed there: Node
v24.19.0, pnpm 11.20.0, gh 2.97.0, git. No Rust, no Solana CLI, no Anchor.

**For Anchor work (Milestones D and E)** you need Rust, the Solana CLI, and Anchor.

On Windows this means **WSL, not native**. Anchor's build shells out to
`cargo-build-sbf`, which does not work reliably on native Windows; Anchor's own docs
point at WSL. Rust and the Solana CLI install fine either way — Anchor is the one that
does not.

```powershell
# PowerShell, AS ADMINISTRATOR. Installs WSL2 + Ubuntu. Requires a reboot.
wsl --install
```

Then, inside the Ubuntu shell:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-anchor.sh
```

That script installs build dependencies, Rust, the Solana CLI, and Anchor via AVM,
persists PATH, and generates a localnet-only keypair. It is idempotent — safe to re-run,
and safe to run on the main PC where some of it already exists.

Expect ~30–60 minutes; compiling AVM from source is the slow part.

### Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test        # 433 tests, all green
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

---

## Conventions

- **TypeScript strict**, plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. Both are on deliberately; do not relax them.
- **`type` aliases, not `interface`**, for anything that gets hashed. Type aliases get an
  implicit index signature and so are assignable to `CanonicalValue`; interfaces are not,
  and switching would break hashing at the type level.
- **Validation returns problems, it does not throw.** A league creator should see
  everything wrong at once.
- **Commits are conventional and explain _why_.** The what is visible in the diff.
- Tests live beside their source as `*.test.ts`.

## Answering a scoring question: verify all three sources

**Standing rule from the owner.** Any question of the form "does X score?" or "how many
points is Y?" gets answered from three places, never from memory:

1. **Tank01** — is the stat actually obtainable, and under what field or text form? Use
   `stats:probe`, `verify`, `discover`, `deep`. Field names guessed from documentation
   have been wrong three times already.
2. **ESPN** — what do they pay, and is it on by default?
3. **Sleeper** — same, and note their category structure. They split "Special Teams
   Player" from "Special Teams Defense", which is the distinction that stopped return
   touchdowns being double-counted.

Answering from any one of the three has produced a wrong answer at least once. The
scoring table is frozen per league and decides who gets paid, so "probably 6 points" is
not good enough.

Record the finding in [`docs/TANK01.md`](docs/TANK01.md) with the verbatim strings, so
the next person does not repeat the lookup.

---

## Working with the owner

Preferences established in practice, not stated as rules:

- **Website before mobile.** The Seeker app matters, but the web app is the priority for
  2026; mobile is Milestone H and off the critical path.
- **Flag risks once, clearly, then build what was asked.** Concerns about the mainnet pot,
  the audit timeline, and winner-take-all were each raised and each answered. They are
  decided — see the settled table below. Re-raising them is noise.
- **Keep notes in the repo, not in a chat window.** This file, `DECISIONS.md`, and
  `SETUP-REQUIRED.md` exist because the owner works across two machines and expects to
  pick up where they left off. Update them as you go rather than at the end.
- **Say what is not done.** The scoring fixtures are constructed rather than real box
  scores, and that is labelled everywhere it appears rather than glossed.

**There are more product ideas the owner has not yet shared.** They said so explicitly
during the initial scoping and the conversation moved on to building. Worth asking before
assuming the current spec is the whole product.

---

## Blocked on the owner

**[`docs/SETUP-REQUIRED.md`](docs/SETUP-REQUIRED.md) is the live list** — accounts, API
keys, and decisions only the owner can supply, each recording what it blocks and when it
is needed. Keep it updated: when you hit something that needs a credential or a call the
owner has to make, add it there rather than stalling or guessing.

Nothing on that list blocks `pnpm test`. The core is deliberately testable without a
single credential.

The two that matter most right now:

- **The escrow audit** — 2–4 weeks of calendar time, gates pot leagues opening on Aug 22.
  Should be quoted _now_, before the program is finished.
- **Bot draft sophistication** — a scope decision needed before Milestone B.
