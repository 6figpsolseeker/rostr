# CLAUDE.md

Context for Claude Code sessions on this repo. Read this first — it is the handoff
between machines and between sessions.

## What this is

**rostr** — open-source fantasy sports on Solana, football first. Web app and native app,
targeting the **Solana Seeker dApp Store**.

Owner: [@6figpsolseeker](https://github.com/6figpsolseeker). Previously shipped
[`percolator-mobile`](https://github.com/6figpsolseeker/percolator-mobile) to Seeker
(React Native 0.81 + Expo 54 bare, Mobile Wallet Adapter, Seed Vault) — **use it as the
reference build for anything mobile.**

The thesis in one line: every other fantasy platform asks you to trust an administrator;
this one replaces that trust with immutable rules, escrowed funds, and automatic
settlement.

## Hard deadlines

Today's date matters more than usual here.

| Date            | What                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aug 22 2026** | Leagues must be creatable, joinable, fundable, **draftable**  |
| **Sep 9 2026**  | **NFL kickoff.** Lineups lock, scoring runs, matchups resolve |
| Sep 16          | Waivers (Week 2)                                              |
| Nov 22          | Trade deadline (Week 11)                                      |
| Dec 13          | First real payout — regular-season prize (Week 14)            |
| Jan 3 2027      | Championship (Week 17)                                        |
| Jan 10 2027     | Final payouts, after the 7-day correction window              |

Two of these are hard: **Aug 22** and **Sep 9**. Everything else has months of runway.
Miss the season and the next real-data window is September 2027.

**The NFL calendar is the release schedule.** Settlement code does not run until January.
Do not build it in August.

## Where we are

See [`docs/BUILD-PLAN.md`](docs/BUILD-PLAN.md) for the full commit-by-commit plan.

**Done — 82 tests, CI green:**

- Full specification — rules, data model, live scoring, build plan
- A1: pnpm monorepo, TS strict, vitest, eslint, prettier, CI
- A2: sport registry (`packages/core/src/sports/`)
- A3–A5: canonical encoding, rule schema, hashing, validation
- A6: Postgres migrations (`packages/db/migrations/`), forward-only runner, PGlite tests
- A7: `seedSport()` and `createLeague()` — validate, hash, freeze, all in one transaction

**Next, in order:**

1. **A8** — pin the canonical rule document to IPFS behind an adapter interface, then
   `setRulesUri()`. Must happen before anyone joins: a league whose `rules_uri` does not
   resolve anchors nothing.
2. **A9–A12** — email + wallet identity, web shell, rules shown before join, join with a
   signature over the rules hash
3. **B1–B5** — the PPR scoring engine, integer milli-points, golden fixtures from real
   2025 box scores
4. **D1–D10** — the escrow program. **Write this early.** The audit is 2–4 weeks of
   calendar time and it gates pot leagues opening on Aug 22.

### League creation

`createLeague()` in `packages/db/src/leagues.ts` is the only moment a league's rules are
writable. It validates, hashes, and writes in a single transaction — so there is no state
in which a league exists with rules that were never checked, and a partial write leaves
nothing behind.

`league_rules.canonical` holds the exact bytes that were hashed, verbatim. That is what
gets pinned, and what anyone can re-hash to check against the chain. `verifyStoredRules()`
does exactly that.

The denormalised `league_scoring_rules` and `league_roster_slots` are **copies**, never
references to a shared template — a template edit must never be able to reach a league
that already exists. They carry the same immutability triggers.

### Database

Tests run on **PGlite** — real Postgres compiled to WASM, in-process, no service, no
Docker, no credentials. `createTestDatabase()` in `packages/db/src/testing.ts` gives a
fresh migrated database per test.

The real database is **Supabase** (hosted, so it follows you between machines; also
matches the stack in `percolator-launch`). Not set up yet — see
[`docs/SETUP-REQUIRED.md`](docs/SETUP-REQUIRED.md).

Migrations are **forward-only** plain SQL. There are no down migrations: a league's rules
are immutable and its history must stay auditable, so the answer to a bad migration is
another migration. Editing an already-applied file makes the runner refuse to start.

---

## Invariants — do not break these

**1. The rules hash is load-bearing.** `packages/core/src/canonical.ts` defines the only
legal encoding of a rule set. Its SHA-256 goes on-chain and members sign it when they
join. If encoding drifts, every league created before the drift stops verifying.

There is a **golden fixture test** pinning
`5afc934db3b3e1b1f5ec7a9e503f61e531aa925a6f966c41ec227118201da36a`. If it fails, do
**not** update the constant to make it pass — find what changed the encoding. CI checks it
on Node 22 and 24 for exactly this reason.

**2. No floating point, anywhere near money or scoring.** Scoring is integer
**milli-points** (1 point = 1000). Percentages are **basis points** (100% = 10000).
Thresholds are explicit numerator/denominator pairs. Token amounts are decimal **strings**
(on-chain u64). `canonicalize()` throws on any non-integer, by design.

Why: passing yards score 0.04/yd. Accumulate floats across a season and matchups decided
by hundredths — which happens constantly — resolve wrong.

**3. Sports are data, never structure.** `packages/core/src/sports/nfl.ts` is the only
file permitted to name a football concept. If you find yourself writing
`if (sport === 'nfl')` or a column called `passing_yards`, the abstraction has leaked.

**4. Rules are immutable after league creation.** No commissioner override, no admin
edit, no migration that touches an existing league's rules. The only escape hatches are
unanimous consent to amend and unanimous/automatic dissolve with refunds.

**5. Paying weeks wait 7 days.** Official NFL stat corrections arrive for up to a week
after a game. Weeks 14 and 17 pay money and must finalise at T+168h. Other weeks finalise
at T+48h. Validation enforces this.

## Settled — do not re-open

These were discussed at length and decided. Re-proposing them wastes the owner's time.

| Decision                                            | Status                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full PPR scoring                                    | **Settled** — table in `docs/RULES.md` §1                        |
| Schedule luck retained                              | **Settled** — median scoring was proposed and **rejected**       |
| Rolling waiver priority                             | **Settled** — FAAB proposed and **rejected** for v1              |
| NFTs _are_ the roster, not souvenirs                | **Settled** — Token-2022, transfer hook + permanent delegate     |
| NFTs persist as trophies, labelled "Player YYYY"    | **Settled**                                                      |
| Trades vetoable, never automatic                    | **Settled** — 48h escrow, ⅓ of uninvolved teams                  |
| Rules immutable, shown before joining               | **Settled**                                                      |
| Per-game score updates, not real-time               | **Settled** — cost is not the reason; simplicity is              |
| Mainnet with the pot live for 2026                  | **Settled** — risks were raised and the owner chose this         |
| Payout 60/15/10/10/5                                | **Settled** — champion must always be largest                    |
| Abandonment: 3 strikes → autolineup + stake forfeit | **Settled**                                                      |
| Consolation bracket pays out                        | **Settled** — it is the anti-abandonment mechanism, not a nicety |
| IP-based sybil blocking                             | **Rejected** — breaks households, defeated by any VPN            |

## Environment

**This repo was started on a secondary Windows PC.** Tooling installed there: Node
v24.19.0, pnpm 11.20.0, gh 2.97.0, git. No Rust, no Solana CLI, no Anchor.

**On the main PC you will need**, beyond Node and pnpm:

```bash
# Rust + Solana + Anchor. On Windows, use WSL — Anchor is painful natively.
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked
avm install latest && avm use latest
```

Anchor work (Milestones D and E) is blocked until that exists.

### Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test        # 49 tests, all green
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

## Conventions

- **TypeScript strict**, plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. Both are on deliberately; do not relax them.
- **`type` aliases, not `interface`**, for anything that gets hashed. Type aliases get an
  implicit index signature and so are assignable to `CanonicalValue`; interfaces are not,
  and switching would break hashing at the type level.
- **Validation returns problems, it does not throw.** A league creator should see
  everything wrong at once.
- **Commits are conventional and explain _why_.** The what is visible in the diff.
- Tests live beside their source as `*.test.ts`.

## Blocked on the owner

**[`docs/SETUP-REQUIRED.md`](docs/SETUP-REQUIRED.md) is the live list** — accounts, API
keys, and decisions only the owner can supply, each recording what it blocks and when it
is needed. Keep it updated: when you hit something that needs a credential or a call the
owner has to make, add it there rather than stalling or guessing.

Nothing on that list blocks `pnpm test`. The core is deliberately testable without a
single credential.

The two that matter most right now:

- **The escrow audit** — 2–4 weeks of calendar time, gates pot leagues opening on Aug 22.
  Should be quoted _now_, before the program is finished.
- **Bot draft sophistication** — a scope decision needed before Milestone B.
